**Runfile is ruby**. You can write any ruby code in it as usual.

> **Tip:** To create an initial Runfile, go to a folder that does not 
> contain one already, and execute `run new`.

Runfile provides several commands to help you define your program 
and a handful of utility functions to make writing beautiful 
command line applications a breeze.

A simple Runfile looks like this ( [more examples](https://github.com/DannyBen/runfile/tree/master/examples) ):

```ruby
usage  "greet <name>"
help   "Say hello to <name>"
action :greet do |args|
	say "Hello #{args['<name>']}" 
end
```
